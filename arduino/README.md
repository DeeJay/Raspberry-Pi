This is a quick conversion of the Arduino strings unit to what should be linux standard C++. Linux lacks the itoa, ltoa etc so they are implemented inside the Ardrino wstrings.c file. A few #defines from print.h and pgmspace.h were copied to the top of wstrings.h as they seem to be used with the strings.

The basic tests I did were the tutorial code from the two sites
